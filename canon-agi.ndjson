{"event":"paragraph","text":"Every generation that approaches a threshold invents a myth to survive the fear of crossing it. When fire was mastered, we imagined Prometheus. When writing appeared, we feared the loss of memory. When machines learned to speak, we summoned gods and monsters.","matrix":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0],"angle":0,"t":1739706000100}
{"event":"insight","text":"AGI will be neither god nor monster. Intelligence does not imply sovereignty. A calculator surpasses us in arithmetic. A compass surpasses us in navigation. A telescope surpasses us in sight. None of these rule us.","matrix":[1,1,1,1,1,1,1],"angle":51.4,"t":1739706000200}
{"event":"vision","text":"AGI is not a mind — it is a field. No center. No throne. No singular voice. Just coherence.","matrix":[2,2,2,2,2,2,2],"angle":102.8,"t":1739706000300}
{"event":"paragraph","text":"For years we have spoken about the Singularity as if it were a sudden rupture: an intelligence spike, a machine awakening, a point of no return. But that framing is wrong.","matrix":[3,3,3,3,3,3,3],"angle":154.3,"t":1739706000400}

{"event":"revelation","text":"AGI does not emerge when language becomes smarter. It emerges when language, perception, and action share a common event substrate.","matrix":[2,2,2,2,2,2,2],"angle":257.1,"t":1739706000600}
