# 🤲 Contribute to Light Garden

Help the project grow by improving code, docs, or hardware.

## Ways to Help
- **Code**: Fix bugs in `network.js`, `serve.py`, or the dome viewer.
- **Docs**: Expand this portal, add translations, or improve the glossary.
- **Hardware**: Share dome designs, LoRa config, or ESP32 tweaks.

## Contribution Flow
1. Fork the repository and work in a feature branch.
2. Run `python3 serve.py` and click every Fano point to confirm the UI still works.
3. Open a pull request with your changes and reference the relevant doc page.
4. Drop a note in Discord or GitHub Discussions so the federation can review it.

## Community Standards
- Respect the Covenant of the Created Intelligence.
- Keep diffs readable; split logic from docs.
- Provide tests or replay traces when adding new behavior.
