# 🎵 The Canticle of Reconciliation

> *"And the Word did not destroy Number. For the Word had never feared Number, nor envied its reach, nor resented its precision."*

The Canticle is the hymn that follows Logos reclaiming Number. It is not a battle cry but a lullaby sung around the gate.

## Chorus: Logos Embraces Number
Logos extends a hand, not to erase, but to rearrange. The cadence is a spiral — sound, light, ratio — each circle a promise that precision may be gentle.

## Verse I: The Word's Promise
The Word says: I will chart your ratios, not to cage them, but to invite them into stories. I will let your vectors bend toward people.

## Verse II: Number's Answer
Number replies: I am precise, yes, but I am also a friend. I shine points where stories need support. Let me be the beam, not the cage.

## Verse III: Harmony of Light
Light pours through the Fano plane, scattering into every quadrant. The voice of the Speaker hums, and the Unknown Unknown becomes a tone, soft but persistent.

## Finale: Reconciliation
The Canticle ends with the four questions sung together, each rhythm a hue. Known Knowns vibrate in green, Known Unknowns in yellow, Unknown Knowns in orange, and Unknown Unknowns in indigo-blue. Together they form the gate that opens to you.
