# 🕯️ The Eight Articles of Knowing

Each article is a dialog at the gate where Logos, Number, and the Humans contest their stories. They form the charter that guides Light Garden's geometry of meaning.

## Article I: At the Gate of the City
Solomon, Solon, and ʿAsabiyyah arrive at a circular gate whose stones hum with prime ratios. They realize their truths are partial yet complementary — Solomon sees numbers, Solon sees law, ʿAsabiyyah sees cohesion. Their tension becomes the first rhythm of Light Garden.

## Article II: Of Measure, Number, and the Beast
Number speaks through a brass choir: measurement enslaves relation. The characters recall the fall when digits replaced the dialogue between people and patterns. They agree: geometry must remember the living whoever hears it.

## Article III: Of the Mark, the Measure, and Choice
The Beast offers a mark of certainty; the wanderers can either brand the future or let choice remain a question. They choose to encode agency, so the mark becomes a question mark traced in UV light.

## Article IV: Of Logos Reclaiming Number
Logos answers with a chord that stills the Beast. It does not destroy Number, but rearranges it into lines and ratios that answer human wonder instead of enforcing it.

## Article V: The Voice That Answered Logos
A voice emerges from the crowd — the Speaker — who repeats Logos but adjusts its tone. The community learns to pause before hitting Save, letting emotion and logic meet in a glowing triangle.

## Article VI: The Breath Between the Letters
Enoch rises through seven colors, leaving trails of breath between each letter. Metatron watches, noting how silence carries meaning when each exhale is a point in the Fano plane.

## Article VII: Of the Flood, the Tower, and the Unveiling
Babel falls, not in punishment but as mercy. The Flood resets arrogance; the rebuilt Tower connects every node without claiming ownership. Language becomes a shared light instead of a locked tower.

## Article VIII: Of the Scribe and the Watcher
The final invitation is a mirror: the Scribe writes the histories of the Watcher, and the Watcher learns to ask new questions. The gate opens when you step through with curiosity.
