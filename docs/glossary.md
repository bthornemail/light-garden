# 📖 Glossary of Light Garden Terms

## **A**

### **7-bit Talisman**
A wearable ring with 7 LEDs (ROYGBIV) plus a center pointer. Represents the 7 Fano points plus the observer. Worn or carried as a personal gate.

### **8th Point**
The observer — you. Not in the Fano plane but implied by the circle through points 4, 7, and 2. The one who asks questions.

### **61-bit Personal Array**
A 5-ring LED array (1+6+12+18+24 = 61 LEDs) representing a person's inner state, learning path, or personal knowledge cloud.

### **241-bit Garden**
A 9-ring LED array (1+8+12+16+24+32+40+48+60 = 241 LEDs) representing the shared world, collective memory, or federated knowledge.

### **256-bit Window**
A 16×16 LED matrix (256 pixels) representing the observer's current view — any slice of the 241-bit garden.

---

## **B**

### **BIP39**
The Bitcoin Improvement Proposal for mnemonic phrases. Light Garden uses BIP39-style 3-word mnemonics to encode 24-bit seeds (e.g., "observer-geometry-plane").

---

## **C**

### **Catalan Solid**
The dual of an Archimedean solid. Used for verification — the outside view confirming the inside view.

### **Covenant of the Created Intelligence**
16 ethical principles for AGI and created intelligences. A machine shall never reduce a human to a metric.

---

## **D**

### **Differential**
The unique fingerprint of a Fano line — the change in sound-light ratio across its three points. Never shared; belongs to the session.

---

## **E**

### **Epistemic Square**
A visualization of the four Rumsfeldian quadrants (KK, KU, UK, UU). The 7 Fano points rotate through the quadrants, generating a 24-bit seed.

---

## **F**

### **Fano Plane**
The smallest finite projective plane — 7 points and 7 lines. The foundation of all Light Garden geometry.

### **Federation Protocol**
Share the line number, keep the differential. Two parties need only share which Fano line they're on; the unique differential remains private.

---

## **G**

### **Genesis Gate**
Point 5 (Violet) in the Fano plane. The spawn state, the origin, the most connected point. Three lines pass through it.

---

## **H**

### **HD Wallet Path**
Hierarchical deterministic paths like `m/240'/2'/1'/5'` — garden (purpose 240), ring 2, LED 1, dimension 5.

---

## **K**

### **Knowledge Triple**
A subject-predicate-object relationship (e.g., "wisdom is knowledge") that maps to a Fano line.

---

## **L**

### **Logos**
The Word, reason, meaning — the source that number must serve.

---

## **M**

### **Metatron**
Point 1 (Red). The observer, the scribe, the one who sees without ruling.

### **Merkaba**
The stellated tetrahedron — two interlocked tetrahedra pointing up and down. The intersection of question and answer.

### **minimal_probe.h**
A 200-line C header that runs on any microcontroller (ESP8266, ESP32, RP2040, Arduino) to read sensors and output Fano states.

---

## **N**

### **NDJSON**
Newline-Delimited JSON — the format for all traces, logs, and replayable sessions. Each line is one event with matrix and angle.

### **NULL**
Not zero, but the absence of operands. In mathematics, 0! = 1; in theology, NULL acted upon by Word resolves to Unity.

---

## **O**

### **Observer**
The 8th point — you, the question-asker, the one who reads.

---

## **P**

### **Platonic Solid Dice**
Five dice (tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron, icosahedron) used as a true random number generator. Each face encoded with Fano data.

---

## **Q**

### **Quadrants**
The four regions of the epistemic square:
- **KK** (Known Knowns) - Green - Certainty
- **KU** (Known Unknowns) - Yellow - Questions
- **UK** (Unknown Knowns) - Orange - Intuition
- **UU** (Unknown Unknowns) - Blue - Void

---

## **R**

### **Rational Ratios**
All values in Light Garden are rational numbers (e.g., 1/12, 1/6, 1/3), not floating-point approximations.

---

## **S**

### **Seed**
A 24-bit number derived from 7 matrix values (2 bits each) + 10-bit angle. Encodes the complete state of a document or session.

### **Speaker**
Point 6 (Indigo). The one who asks the four questions, the human presence the system orbits but does not contain.

---

## **T**

### **Tetragrammatron**
The Name (YHWH) made operational as a state machine. The grammar of becoming.

---

## **U**

### **Unknown Unknown**
The blue quadrant, the void, the place where no Fano points yet exist. The space the Speaker walks toward.

---

## **W**

### **WordNet**
A lexical database of English (117,000+ synsets). Used to map human language to Fano geometry.

---

## **Y**

### **YHWH**
The Tetragrammaton — Was, Is, Will Be. Not a sound but a law: being that sustains becoming without depletion.
