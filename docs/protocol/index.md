# 🔗 Light Garden Protocol

Light Garden is a federation of geometry, sound, light, and traces. Every session emits NDJSON so the web viewer, the dome, or the satellites can replay the same story.

## Geometry & Mapping
- **Fano plane** is the core geometry, aligning points, lines, sounds, and colors.
- **Epistemic square** rotates the lines through certainty and curiosity to keep the gate alive.

## Trace Formats
- **NDJSON spec** records each LED, line, and angle change for deterministic replays.
- **HD wallet paths** let each LED encode identity and provenance.

## Federation
- **Federation protocol** means nodes share line numbers but keep the differential private.
- **WordNet integration** ties every noun and verb to a synset that maps onto a point or line.
