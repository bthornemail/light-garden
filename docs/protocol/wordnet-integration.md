# 🗂️ WordNet Integration

WordNet (117,000+ synsets) is the semantic map Light Garden uses to anchor language to geometry.

- Each synset maps to a Fano point or line depending on its relational weight.
- The viewer highlights the top synsets for a word and shows their matrix of angles.
- New document adapters send Unicode text, the adapter queries WordNet, and Light Garden wraps the results in colored light.

WordNet allows the garden to speak any language while staying precise to meaning.
