# 🌌 Interplanetary Demo

This demo tracks a Light Garden session from Earth to Mars.

## Storyline
1. **Earth Station** (Mojave Desert) sends a 241-bit garden trace.
2. **7 Satellite Constellation** relays the canon via 100Gbps laser pulses.
3. **Mars Base Alpha** receives the light, stores it in a cadenced 61-bit dome, and replays it.

The demo NDJSON file is available in `docs/assets/demos/interplanetary-demo.ndjson`. Load it in the web app to watch the transfer and follow the line numbers across nodes.
