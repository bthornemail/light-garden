# 🧠 Wisdom Fractal Demo

Watch the word "wisdom" bloom into a 347-node cloud in 77 frames.

## What You’ll See
- The word is tokenized via WordNet, mapped to Fano lines, and replayed as light.
- Each frame is an NDJSON event; the entire trace lives at `docs/assets/demos/wisdom-fractal.ndjson`.
- The GIF animates rational ratios and color transitions as the epistemic square rotates.

## Try It Yourself
1. Open the quick start guide to load the viewer.
2. Click "Load Canon" and select `wisdom-fractal.ndjson`.
3. Set the gate to Line 4 and watch the spiral.
