title: Light Garden - A Geometric Language for Meaning
---

# 🌱 Light Garden

**A federated, geometric language for encoding meaning, consciousness, and knowledge into light.**

*Watch a single word ("wisdom") bloom into a universe of 347 concepts in 7.7 seconds.*

## 🎯 **What is Light Garden?**

Light Garden is a complete system for **encoding any document, any sensor reading, any thought into a geometric fingerprint** that can be:

- **Visualized** as colored light patterns on LED arrays
- **Audiolized** as musical notes (A-G scale)
- **Transmitted** via LoRa, WiFi, or laser across any distance
- **Federated** across a global network of nodes
- **Replayed** from NDJSON traces
- **Extended** by anyone with a $3 ESP32

It's built on the **Fano plane** — the smallest finite projective geometry (7 points, 7 lines) — and uses **WordNet** (117,000+ synsets) to map human language to geometric form.

## 🌟 **Core Philosophy**

> *"The Unknown Unknown has a frequency. You just haven't played the right line yet to find it."*

Light Garden is grounded in a narrative universe of eight characters who embody different ways of knowing:

| Point | Character | Role | Color | Ratio |
|-------|-----------|------|-------|-------|
| 1 | Metatron | Observer | Red | 0 |
| 2 | Solomon | Wisdom | Orange | 1/12 |
| 3 | Solon | Law | Yellow | 1/6 |
| 4 | ʿAsabiyyah | Cohesion | Green | 1/3 |
| 5 | Enoch | Scribe | Blue | 2/3 |
| 6 | Speaker | Voice | Indigo | 3/4 |
| 7 | Genesis | Origin | Violet | 5/6 |
| 8 | Observer | You | White | S=0 |

## 🌍 **The Interplanetary Vision**

Light Garden scales from your desk to Mars:

```
Earth Station (Mojave Desert) → 7 Satellite Constellation → Mars Base Alpha
   241-bit Garden Array           Fano Relays                61-bit Personal Dome
       5kW solar                   100Gbps laser                225M km distance
```
